# 5G NR Performance Evaluation Report

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the performance of 5G New Radio (5G NR) mobile telecommunications systems. It analyzes various scenarios to optimize packet transmission services using Massive MIMO technology and numerology 2. The study covers two primary environments: an indoor factory setting (InFSH) and a stadium (Std).

## Key Topics

- **5G New Radio (5G NR):** Next-generation mobile network standard designed for higher speed, lower latency, and greater device connectivity.
- **Scenarios Studied:** Comparison between indoor factory (InFSH) and stadium (Std) environments.
- **Performance Metrics:** Throughput, power efficiency, spectral efficiency, and coverage area.
- **Massive MIMO:** Use of multiple antennas to enhance network capacity and efficiency.

## Key Findings

- **Throughput and Coverage:** Higher in stadium scenarios compared to indoor factory settings due to user density and fewer physical obstructions.
- **Power Transmission:** Increased power leads to better throughput and coverage in both scenarios.
- **Spectral Efficiency:** Greater efficiency in stadium environments, especially with multiple radio links (3 RL) compared to a single radio link (1 RL).

## Conclusion

The study highlights the advantages of 5G NR in high-density environments and the importance of optimizing transmission power and multiple radio links for enhanced network performance. Further research is needed to explore additional factors affecting network efficiency and to achieve optimal performance in various real-world scenarios.
